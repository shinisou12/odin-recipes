            <p>Omurice is a popular modern Japanese dish that's a mashup of Western omelets and Japanese fried rice.</p>
            <p>Although everyone makes it a little differently, the omelette is usually stuffed with chicken rice, which is fried rice that's made with chicken and seasoned with ketchup. 
               This gives it a vibrant red color and savory sweet taste, that's the trademark flavor of this dish.

               As for the egg, classic styles of omurice were made into an oval shape and wrapped in a thin layer of egg, but these days, many people ditch the thin papery egg for a luscious blanket of soft scrambled eggs on top.</p>
