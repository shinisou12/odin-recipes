        <h1>Omurice</h1>
        <img src="../img/omurice.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="Freshly Cooked Omurice">
            <p>Omurice is a popular modern Japanese dish that's a mashup of Western omelets and Japanese fried rice.</p>
            <p>Although everyone makes it a little differently, the omelette is usually stuffed with chicken rice, which is fried rice that's made with chicken and seasoned with ketchup. 
               This gives it a vibrant red color and savory sweet taste, that's the trademark flavor of this dish.

               As for the egg, classic styles of omurice were made into an oval shape and wrapped in a thin layer of egg, but these days, many people ditch the thin papery egg for a luscious blanket of soft scrambled eggs on top.</p>

                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cream</li>

        <h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
            <h4>For Chicken Rice</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the chicken in the soy sauce while you prepare all the other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Break the eggs into a bowl along with the cream and salt. Whisk together until the mixture is uniform in color.</li>
                <li>Add the vegetable oil and onions to a frying pan over medium-high heat and saute the onions until they're tender and just starting to brown.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken and stir-fry until you don't see any raw sides anymore.</li>
                <li>Add the rice, and break it up with a spatula so that it heats through evenly.</li>
                <li>Once the rice has been warmed through, add the ketchup and oyster sauce, and stir-fry until the rice is an even color and the ketchup is just starting to caramelize. Season with black pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Plate the rice. You can use a bowl as a mold to give it a round or oval shape.</li>
            </ol>    
            <h4>For Omelette</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a small 8-inch non-stick frying pan over medium heat until moderately hot. Add the butter and swirl to melt and coat the pan evenly.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, and cook until the bottom layer of eggs are set (the bottom will start turning opaque).</li>
                <li>Gently stir the eggs, while shaking the pan to resettle the uncooked egg.</li>
                <li>Turn up the heat to high for a few seconds to make the egg easier to slide out of the pan (the egg should slide around the pan easily when shaken).</li>
                <li>Position the pan over the plated rice and gently slide the egg out of the pan onto the rice.</li>
                <li>Garnish with ketchup and parsley to taste.</li>
            </ol>
