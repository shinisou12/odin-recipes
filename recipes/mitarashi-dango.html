        <h1>Mitarashi Dango</h1>
        <img src="../img/mitarashi-dango.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="Mitarashi Dango for your pleasure">
            <p>Mitarashi Dango is a classic Japanese snack and street food made by skewering rice dumplings and grilling them before glazing them in a thick sweet soy glaze.</p>
            <p>Most of the flavor comes from the thick and shiny Mitarashi Dango Sauce used to glaze the dumplings. It's made with a combination of sugar, soy sauce, and starch, giving it a sweet and savory taste that's a little sweeter than teriyaki sauce. The dango are soft, springy, and chewy and have a nutty rice cracker flavor due to the way they're grilled at the end. </p>
        <h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1>

               <ul>
                <li>90 grams shiratamako<sub>(~1/2 cup)</sub></li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup + 1/2 tablespoon water</li>
               </ul>
            <h3>Mitarashi Dango Sauce</h3>
               <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice syrup<sub>(or corn syrup)</sub></li>
                <li>1 tablespoon kokutou</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon potato starch</li>
               </ul>
        <h1><strong>Instructions</strong></h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Set a large pot of water on to boil. If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water.</li>
                <li>Whisk the shiratamako and salt together in a large bowl and then pour in the water. Whisk together until the flour is evenly hydrated and crumbly.</li>
                <li>Use your hand to knead the dough into a smooth mass. If the dough is too wet, knead in a bit more shiratamako. If it's too dry and crumbly, knead another teaspoon of water. The dough should be about the texture of playdough.</li>
                <li>Use a scale to portion the dough and roll it into spheres with your hands. Each ball should be about 9.5 grams (1/3 ounce), and you should have around 16 balls.</li>
                <li>Gently roll the shaped dango into the boiling water and let them cook for a minute before giving them a stir.</li>
                <li>Cook the rice dumplings until they float to the surface, and then set a timer for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>When the timer is up, transfer the dango to a bowl of cold tap water to chill before draining.</li>
                <li>Skewer four dumplings per skewer.</li>
                <li>Heat a seasoned cast iron skillet until scorching hot.</li>
                <li>Whisk the sauce ingredients together in a separate pan until the starch has dissolved.</li>
                <li>Add the dumpling skewers making sure they don't stick together, and grill until they're browned on one side. You can use a spatula to press down on them, so they brown evenly.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat on for the sauce and bring the mixture to a boil while stirring constantly. Continue boiling the sauce until it's thick, but not so much that it turns gloppy. Remove the sauce from the heat.</li>
                <li>Once the skewers have browned on one side, flip them over and brown the second side.</li>
                <li>Plate the finished Mitarashi Dango and spoon over the sauce.</li>
            </ol>
